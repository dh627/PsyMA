        <h2>
          The Psychedelic Medicine Association is a society of physicians,
          therapists, and health care professionals looking to advance their
          education on the therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines.
        </h2>

        <p>
          The psychedelic revolution isn’t coming – it’s here. Ketamine is a
          legal medicine, and MDMA and psilocybin are on the fast track to
          becoming FDA-approved. However, the majority of healthcare providers
          on the front lines of patient care are unaware of the burgeoning field
          of psychedelic-based therapeutics.
        </p>

        <p>
          What good is revolutionary psychedelic medicine if physicians aren't
          comfortable talking about them let alone recommending, or even
          prescribing them?
        </p>

        <p>
          The Psychedelic Medicine Association (PMA) is a public benefit
          corporation of healthcare providers aimed at bridging the gap between
          the advances taking place in the psychedelic research world and
          medical practitioners.
